  /** Before your plugin can add activity, it must register itself as a source by using the mngl-activity-types filter
    * to add a code (the key of your array entry), name and icon url. Here's an example from the MnglBoardsController class:
    *
    * function MnglBoardsController()
    * {
    *   add_filter('mngl-activity-types', array( $this, 'add_activity_types' ));
    * }
    *

    * {
    *   $activity_types['board_posts'] = array( 'name' => 'Board Posts',
    *                                             'message' => '%1$s commented on %2$s\'s post';
    *                                             'icon' => MNGL_URL . '/images/board_post.png' );
    *   $activity_types['board_comments'] = array( 'name' => 'Board Comments',
    *                                                'message' => '{$owner->screenname} commented on {$author_profile_link}\'s post',
    *                                                'icon' => MNGL_URL . '/images/board_comment.png' );
    *   return $activity_types;
